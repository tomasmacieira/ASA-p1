# ASA 2023- Project 1

## Introduction
This project was made in the Analysis and synthesis of algorithms course

## Description
Given a plate of X & Y dimensions, and N tiles with values V, by cutting the plate into smaller ones,
what is the maximum value we can obtain

## How to compile and run
```s
make p1
```
```s
./p1
```

## Input format
The first line must have the dimentions of the plate: `{plate_height} {plate_width}`

The second line must have the number of tiles: `{number_of_tiles}`

The next N lines must have the dimensions and value of the tiles: `{tile_height} {tile_width} {tile_value}`
